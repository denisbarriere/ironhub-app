A single page application, based on the MEAN stack, that was initially built in **two weeks** as my last project of the **one week of pair programming**, as part of the **Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp in Barcelona** (at the end of module 3, weeks 8 and 9 of the program).

Ironhub's MVP includes a directory of Ironhack students and a directory of student projects. The goal of the project is for people at Ironhack (staff, teachers, TAs and students) to have a central place to get people's information and projects.

There are still a lot of things to implement and improve. All is listed in a Trello board I can share.

Finally, the project is deployed to Heroku and can be accessed [here](https://ironhub-app.herokuapp.com).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

1. Have Node.js installed. Please see [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) for more installation instructions.

### Installing

Ironhub is made of two different repositories:
1. The APP: [ironhub-app](https://github.com/denisbarriere/ironhub-app)
2. The API: [ironhub-api](https://github.com/denisbarriere/ironhub-api)

**To install the APP**
1. Download the .zip package or clone the project to your local machine
* If you download the .zip file, please extract it to a local directory on your machine 

2. Run the 'npm install' command in your terminal
3. Start the app by running the following command line in a terminal: 'ng serve'. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
4. Make sure you have the Ironhub API already installed and running locally

You are now good to go. You can access the app locally in your web browser at the following URL: [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)
